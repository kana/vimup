Usage
-----

	vimup new-script {script-name}
		Upload a new script package of non-existing script.

	vimup update-script {script-name}
		Upload a new script package of existing script.
		Update also the description in the script page.

	vimup update-details {script-name}
		Update the description in the script page.

Where {script-name} is arbitrary string.  vimup reads the file named
"{script-name}.vimup" for the meta data of a script, for example, the name,
the version, the description and various information of a script.

The content of "{script-name}.vimup" is a hash written in YAML format.
- See sample.vimup to know how to write the meta data of a script.
- See also "vimup-info-generator" which generates "{script-name}.vimup" from
  the document file for a script.  Though it is ad hoc one, it is still useful
  to automate this task.

In "{script-name}.vimup", you have to write the following items:

"script_name"
	The name of a script.

"script_id"
	The ID of a script, where ID is in the URI of the script page:
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id={ID}

	This item can be ommited for "new-script" command.  Because the ID of
	a script is not undefined at the moment.

"script_type"
	The type of a script.  Valid value is one of the following:

	- color scheme
	- ftplugin
	- game
	- indent
	- patch
	- syntax
	- utility

"script_package"
	The name of the file to be uploaded.  This value may have the
	following escape sequences:

	{script_name}
		Replaced with the value of "script_name".

	{version}
		Replaced with the latest version number listed in "version".

"required_vim_version"
	The required Vim version.  Valid value is one of the followings:

	- 5.7
	- 6.0
	- 7.0
	- 7.2

"summary"
	The one-line summary of what a script is.  This value should be
	shorter.  This value is used in various places in www.vim.org, for
	example, the title of the page for a script.

"detailed_description"
	The description which is showed in the page for a script.

"install_details"
	The details of how to install a script.  Like "detailed_description",
	this value is also showed in the page for a script.

"versions"
	List of pairs of a version number and the description for that
	version.  A pair is expressed as a hash with single item, where the
	key of the item is a version number and the corresponding value is
	the description about the changes in that version.

	Note that the first item of this list must be for the latest version.
